# Introduction to Rent Car Management System:
This project is a Rent Car Management System built in C#, designed to help car rental businesses manage customers, vehicles, bookings, rentals, and reports efficiently.


# Notes:
This system was developed as a learning project to explore and apply DevOps concepts and practices. It is designed for anyone interested in learning DevOps through hands-on experience.

Please note that the project may contain errors or areas where best practices have not been fully applied. As mentioned earlier, the focus was on education and development, so only the minimum viable features have been implemented. If time permits, additional features and improvements will be added.

We welcome feedback and contributions from the community to enhance the project further.
